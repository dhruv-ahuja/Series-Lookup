##Check For Show Updates and Get Toast Notifications

#About
This is my first ever individual project and I wanted to make something which I could use myself in my day-to-day life. I don't check my mails too often so I thought it would be neat to make an app that has the ability to check for updates and show notifications if any show has received a new season.

It took me ~3 weeks to code the app to the point where I would consider it useful and I'm sure there are still some bugs I may have missed.

You can search for your shows of choice whose data is scraped through IMDb initially and add the show to a local database(.txt file).
